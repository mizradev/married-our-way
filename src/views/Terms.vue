          <h2 class="text-left">Terms and Conditions of the Married Our Way Agreement</h2> <br>
          <p class="text-justify">
            1. <strong>Consent and Ethical Relations:</strong> Both parties confirm that each party is over the age of 18 (eighteen), and is of sound intellectual ability to understand this agreement. Parties herein are solely responsible for every aspect of this agreement.
            <br>
            2. <strong> Marriage:</strong>   The term “Marriage” as used herein shall NOT imply or in any way suggest the existence or formation by this Agreement, of a civil union, marriage by common law, partnership, joint venture, or any other relationship between the parties that imposes on either of them the legal duties or obligations on or to the other party whatsoever. Each party hereto is free and independent, not an agent or employee of the other party, and shall not have the ability to legally bind the other party to anything, including contracts (whether express or implied), medical debt or other obligations. Either party shall not have any authority whatsoever, without the prior written consent of both parties, to bind either party to any contract, representation, understanding, act or deed concerning the relationship, the services to be performed, or any other service or obligation. Both parties knowingly and expressly understand that this Agreement is for the sole and only purpose to agree on the use of the titles and words (e.g. husband, wife, marriage, and any other similar titles) to describe parties’ relationship.
            <br>
            3. <strong>No Legal Claim of Marriage:</strong> Each party agrees to never claim to be legally married to the other party on any government or legal document if that document is specifically asking for a Marriage License issued by State or government agency.
            <br>
            4. <strong>Property:</strong> Both parties will keep all finances separate. Any commingling of assets or income will be presumed to be unintentional and neither party shall be entitled to claim any portion, or increase in value of the other party’s assets. Neither party will ever expect to benefit from the other party’s finances, real property, intellectual property, inheritance, retirement, or anything with monetary value unless granted with the prior written consent of both parties in a separate agreement.
            <br>
            5. <strong>Palimony: </strong> Both parties agree that either party is not financially responsible for the other party if the relationship ends. Any financial assistance, sacrifices made, career assistance, or any items of value incurred during the relationship will viewed solely as a gift and both parties knowingly and expressly agree to waive any claim to financial assistance, real property, intellectual property, career advancements, or any claim that requires continued support of any kind if the relationship ends, notwithstanding any difference in income.
            <br>
            6. <strong>No State Marriage License:</strong> Parties agree that Marriage is a personal liberty that does NOT require permission from the State, and marriage is rather a commitment between two individuals. Thus both parties acknowledge this Agreement is NOT a legal Marriage License or Certificate issued by any State, Territory, Country, or governmental agency.
            <br>
            7. <strong>Termination:</strong> Either party can simply end the relationship and cancel this Agreement, meaning the use of title MARRIAGE and the like, without the consent of the other party and without anything in writing, for any reason whatsoever. However, either party may choose to notify the other party in writing if the relationship ends.
